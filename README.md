# Wordle
This project is a naive wordle solver and command line wordle client.
The wordle binary will play a game with you and the solver binary will attempty to win a game being played
The only magic you'll need to know is how to encode the response for the solver.
0 is a red square (letter not in word) 1 is a yellow square (letter in word but not at that location) and 2 is a green square (letter in the word at that spot).
